The `Card` component is one of the most versatile components for displaying different types of information in a neat, clear format â€” it can contain text, links, images, and even other components.

Cards serve as an entry point to more detailed information. They present the user with options and give a summary of the information that's available, allowing users to decide what pieces of content they're interested in before going any further.

## Properties

<ArgsTable for={CardStories.Default} />

## Usage

Cards are made up of several different elements, all of which are optional:

- **Title**: A brief summary or identifier for the card.
- **Content**: The main text or information that the card offers.
- **Size**: You can define five different sizes of cards: 'xs', 'sm', 'md', 'lg', 'xl'.
- **Style**: Cards can have an outlined or filled style.
- **Background Color**: Allows customization of the card's background color.
- **Clickable**: Cards can be made clickable.

### Default

The component provides sensible defaults to make usage as simple as possible. By default, the card is of medium size and filled style.

<Canvas>
  <Story name={CardStories.Default.name} of={CardStories.Default} />
</Canvas>

### Extra Small, Small, Large and Extra Large

You can choose different sizes of the card depending on the information you wish to display. The available sizes are: 'xs', 'sm', 'md', 'lg', 'xl'. Here are examples for extra small, small, large and extra large sizes.

<Canvas>
  <Story name={CardStories.ExtraSmall.name} of={CardStories.ExtraSmall} />
  <Story name={CardStories.Small.name} of={CardStories.Small} />
  <Story name={CardStories.Large.name} of={CardStories.Large} />
  <Story name={CardStories.ExtraLarge.name} of={CardStories.ExtraLarge} />
</Canvas>

### Filled and Outlined

Cards are filled by default. But you can also choose an outlined style, if it suits your design better.

<Canvas>
  <Story name={CardStories.Filled.name} of={CardStories.Filled} />
  <Story name={CardStories.Outlined.name} of={CardStories.Outlined} />
</Canvas>

### Card with Image

The Card component can also display an image. To do this, pass the image URL to the `image` prop. Here's an example:

<Canvas>
  <Story name={CardStories.WithImage.name} of={CardStories.WithImage} />
</Canvas>

### Custom Background Color

You can also choose a custom background color for your card. Pass the color value to the `backgroundColor` prop.

<Canvas>
  <Story name={CardStories.WithImage.name} of={CardStories.WithCustomBackground} />
</Canvas>

### Clickable

Cards can be clickable, activating an action or navigation when the user interacts with them. Just pass a function to the `onClick` prop.

<Canvas>
  <Story name={CardStories.Clickable.name} of={CardStories.Clickable} />
</Canvas>

With these options, the `Card` component gives you a lot of flexibility to adapt its appearance and behavior to suit your needs. Enjoy using it!
