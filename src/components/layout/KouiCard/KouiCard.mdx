# Card

The `Card` component is one of the most versatile components for displaying different types of information in a neat, clear format â€” it can contain text, links, images, and even other components.

Cards serve as an entry point to more detailed information. They present the user with options and give a summary of the information that's available, allowing users to decide what pieces of content they're interested in before going any further.

## Properties

<ArgTypes for={CardStories.Playground} />

## Usage

Cards are made up of several different elements, all of which are optional:

- **Background Color**: Allows customisation of the card's background color. You can select from the predefined color palette options: 'blue', 'green', 'red', 'white', 'black', 'grey', 'dark-grey', 'light-grey', and 'yellow'.

- **Border Radius**: Adjusts the roundness of the card's corners. Different values such as 'none', 'sm', 'DEFAULT', 'md', 'lg', and 'full' can be selected.

- **Border Color**: Lets you customise the card's border color.

- **Shadow**: Sets a shadow for the card which can be adjusted according to different levels: 'sm', 'md', and 'lg'.

- **Shadow Opacity**: Adjusts the opacity of the shadow for the card. You can provide a numeric value to set the shadow's opacity.

- **Image**: Cards can include images. You can provide a source URL string for the image.

- **Outlined**: An outlined card has a border. It can be set to true or false.

- **Dark Mode**: Cards can be displayed in dark mode, which simply changes the text to white. Set the `dark` prop to `true` for dark mode.

- **Clickable**: Cards can be made clickable. You can provide an `onClick` handler function for the click event.

Remember, all these options are optional and can be combined to create diverse and customised cards according to your needs.

### Filled and Outlined

Cards are filled by default. But you can also choose an outlined style, if it suits your design better.

<Canvas>
  <Story of={CardStories.Filled} />
  <Story of={CardStories.Outlined} />
</Canvas>

### Card with Image

The Card component can also display an image. To do this, pass the image URL to the `image` prop. Here's an example:

<Canvas>
  <Story of={CardStories.WithImage} />
</Canvas>

### Custom Background Color

You can also choose a custom background color for your card. Pass the color value to the `backgroundColor` prop.

<Canvas>
  <Story of={CardStories.WithCustomBackground} />
</Canvas>

### Clickable

Cards can be clickable, activating an action or navigation when the user interacts with them. Just pass a function to the `onClick` prop.

<Canvas>
  <Story of={CardStories.Clickable} />
</Canvas>

With these options, the `Card` component gives you a lot of flexibility to adapt its appearance and behavior to suit your needs. Enjoy using it!
