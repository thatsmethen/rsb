# Card

The `Card` component is one of the most versatile components for displaying different types of information in a neat, clear format â€” it can contain text, links, images, and even other components.

Cards serve as an entry point to more detailed information. They present the user with options and give a summary of the information that's available, allowing users to decide what pieces of content they're interested in before going any further.

## Properties

<ArgTypes for={CardStories.Playground} />

## Usage

Cards are made up of several different elements, all of which are optional:

- **Title**: A brief summary or identifier for the card.
- **Content**: The main text or information that the card offers.
- **Size**: You can define five different sizes of cards: 'xs', 'sm', 'md', 'lg', 'xl'.
- **Style**: Cards can have an outlined or filled style.
- **Background Color**: Allows customization of the card's background color.
- **Clickable**: Cards can be made clickable.

### Filled and Outlined

Cards are filled by default. But you can also choose an outlined style, if it suits your design better.

<Canvas>
  <Story of={CardStories.Filled} />
  <Story of={CardStories.Outlined} />
</Canvas>

### Card with Image

The Card component can also display an image. To do this, pass the image URL to the `image` prop. Here's an example:

<Canvas>
  <Story of={CardStories.WithImage} />
</Canvas>

### Custom Background Color

You can also choose a custom background color for your card. Pass the color value to the `backgroundColor` prop.

<Canvas>
  <Story of={CardStories.WithCustomBackground} />
</Canvas>

### Clickable

Cards can be clickable, activating an action or navigation when the user interacts with them. Just pass a function to the `onClick` prop.

<Canvas>
  <Story of={CardStories.Clickable} />
</Canvas>

With these options, the `Card` component gives you a lot of flexibility to adapt its appearance and behavior to suit your needs. Enjoy using it!
